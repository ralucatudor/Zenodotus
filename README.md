#### Name motivation
The first recorded Librarian was Zenodotus (Ζηνόδοτος) of Ephesus, holding that post from the end of Ptolemy I's reign. He was a Greek grammarian, literary critic, and Homeric scholar. A native of Ephesus and a pupil of Philitas of Cos, he was the first librarian of the Library of Alexandria.

----------

Express is a framework for building web applications on top of Node.js (Node allows you to use JavaScript as your server-side language).

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It is a set of operations we get servers to execute (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests respectively). This is what each operation does:

  - Create (POST) - Make something
  - Read (GET)- Get something
  - Update (PUT) - Change something
  - Delete (DELETE)- Remove something

POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests let us construct Rest APIs.


Use `npm run dev`
